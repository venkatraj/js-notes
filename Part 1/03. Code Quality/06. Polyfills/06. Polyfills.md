# Polyfills
After ES5, javascript continuously evolves every year. Not all browser's JS Engine supports all the new features of Modern javascript.

## Babel
It is a transpiler. Meaning that it turns the modern javascript code we write, into previous generation javascript code which is understandable by all browsers.


## Polyfills
Babel is not sufficient, when there is a built-in function is added as new feature. For example, babel can convert `let` variable into a `var` variable. However, it can't convert a new built-in function to an old one. So, we need polyfills to do just that.

Core JS and Polyfill.io are two interesting polyfills
