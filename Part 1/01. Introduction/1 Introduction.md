# Introduction
Initially made in the dial-up age of internet to avoid to and fro server communication frustrations. 

Was developed in 14 days and has its quirks.

Initially name "Live Script", but named as "JavaScript" to take advantage of popularity of Java

There are different JS Engines and standards. Let us not worry about it now. We will take care of it when It comes to deploy our programs. For now, let's focus on language itself.

  - Chrome and Opera uses a javascript engine codenamed `V8` 
  - Firefox uses a javascript engine codenamed `SpiderMonkey` 
  - Different IE versions uses different javascript engines codenamed `Trident`, `Chakra` and `ChakraCore` (Edge) 
  - Safari uses javascript engines codenamed `Nitro` and `SquirrelFish` 

## What Engines do?
1. The engine reads (`parses`) the script.
2. Then it converts (`compiles`) the script to the machine language.
3. And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.
4. Optimizes code as it needs

## Uses
Decides behavior layer of a web page. But can be used in server as well with NodeJS technology
1. DOM Manipulation
2. Responding to events
3. Sending network requests, download and upload files (Ajax and COMET)
4. Set cookies, ask questions or show messages to visitors
5. localStorage
