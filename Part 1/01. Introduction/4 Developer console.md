# Developer Console
This helps to debug our code. All modern browsers has built in developer console. Mostly can be opened with `F12` shortcut

If there are errors in our code, which will be displayed in `console` tab in `red` color. There will be a link (with line no. the error occurs) to the file on the right hand side. 

You can run code in console. `Enter` executes code and `Shift+Enter` helps to type multi line code in `console`


We can learn all about developer console as a separate course later.
