# JavaScript Specials

## Code structure
Statements are terminated with semicolon, but it is optional as there is `automatic semicolon insertion` algorithm in JS Engine

If the new line of code starts with brakets (round or square) then you need `;`

```js
// There will be error
alert("There will be an error after this message")
[1, 2].forEach(alert)
```

## Strict mode
To use modern javascript we need to start js files with 'use strict`

## Variables
`let, const and var`
