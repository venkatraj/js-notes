# Searching: getElement*, querySelector*

So far we have seen properties to find out near by elements and fixed position elements 
such as `siblings` and `firstChild`

To search for an arbitrary element in document, DOM have additional methods

## document.getElementByID
This can only be used on `document`, not on any elements. Because there is only one unique id, it is also available as variable

```html
<div id="branding">
  <div id="title">Company Title</div>
</div>

<script>
  // get the element
  let elem = document.getElementById('branding');
  // make its background red
  elem.style.background = 'red';
  title.style.background = 'yellow'
</script>
```
Using ids directly, like `title` is NOT recommended as it is confusing, if we declare same named variables in our script. Also at first sight we many wonder ourself where does the `title` variable comes from, if we haven't seen the HTML

## querySelectorAll
This is most common used method now a days, as it returns elements matching given CSS selector.
Since we can use CSS selectors to select any element in HTML and style it, it is most useful in javascript as well. It returns all elements that matches the selector as array like iterable

```html
<ul id="the-list">
  <li>The</li>
  <li>test</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>has</li>
  <li>passed</li>
</ul>
<script>
  const myList = document.querySelectorAll('#the-list')
  // same as
  // const myList = document.getElementByID('the-list')
  let elements = document.querySelectorAll('ul > li:last-child');

  for (let elem of elements) {
    alert(elem.innerHTML); // "test", "passed"
  }
</script>
```

## querySelector
Since the `querySelectorAll` looks for all elements that matches given selector, it is slow compared to `querySelector`. 

This method just looks for first element that matches the given selector. And the result is an Element, not a collection

## matches
This method checks whether the element matches the given selector and returns `true` or `false`. Useful for filtering a collection

```html
<a href="http://example.com/file.zip">...</a>
<a href="http://ya.ru">...</a>

<script>
  // can be any collection instead of document.body.children
  for (let elem of document.body.children) {
    if (elem.matches('a[href$="zip"]')) {
      alert("The archive reference: " + elem.href );
    }
  }
</script>
```

## closest

Often times we handle with a collection of same kind of HTML structure. For example, a `our team` section. We will have a div with class `team-member` and it has avatar, title, designation, social links and so on

Once we worked with a single member we may want to go next member. For that, for example after working with social links, we need to go to its parent and then its nextElementSibling 

```html
<div id="our-team">

  <!-- Member One -->
  <div class="team-member">
    <div class="team-avatar">
      <img alt="" src="member1.png">
    </div>
  <div class="team-social">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://google.com/">Google</i></a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="team-content">
    <h4>Feugiat Curces <span>Senior Manager</span></h4>
    <p>Vivamus nec massa quis ligula pulvinar sodales. Donec sit amet placerat ipsum. Sed consequat, est in consectetur dapibus, turpis ligula vehicula sapien.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Member Two -->
  <div class="team-member">
    <div class="team-avatar">
      <img alt="" src="member1.png">
    </div>
  <div class="team-social">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://google.com/">Google</i></a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="team-content">
    <h4>Feugiat Curces <span>Senior Manager</span></h4>
    <p>Vivamus nec massa quis ligula pulvinar sodales. Donec sit amet placerat ipsum. Sed consequat, est in consectetur dapibus, turpis ligula vehicula sapien.</p>
  </div>

</div>

<script>
  // Select first .team-member
  // Do some work with internal elements such as social link
  
  // Now move to great parent 
  elem.closest('.team-member')

  // Go to next member
  elem.closest('.team-member').nextElementSibling

  // Do some work with this member as well
</script>
```

## getElementsBy*
Since we can use `querySelector*` for almost all elements, these methods are given only for completedness. Can be seen in old code and rarely used in new 

`getElementsByTagName(tag)` find all elements by Tag name. Can even use `*` to select all elements
`getElementsByClassName(classname)` find all elements with give class name.
`getElementsByName(name)` find all elements with given `name` attribute

`getElementsBy*` methods are live where as `getElementByID` and `querySelector*` are static

```html
<div>First div</div>

<script>
  let liveDivs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
  let staticDivs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
  console.log(liveDivs.length); // 1
  console.log(staticDivs.length); // 1
</script>

<div>Second div</div>

<script>
  // Since it is live and second div is added to document
  // after running above script
  console.log(liveDivs.length); // 2

  // static does not change
  console.log(staticDivs.length); // 1
</script>
```
