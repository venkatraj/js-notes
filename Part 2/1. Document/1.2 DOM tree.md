# DOM Tree
DOM stands for Document Object Model. In DOM, every html tag is an object. Nested tags are children objects of enclosing one. Even text and comments are objects in DOM Tree. Everything in the html document (including spaces and new line character) will become part of DOM as nodes.
It will look something like this (can be seen in developer tools)
-html
  -head
    -#text (new line and spaces)
    -title
      -#text (title text)
    -#text (spaces and new line)
  -#text (spaces and new line)
  -body
    -#text (body text)

As you can see from above everything is converted in to a node in DOM.

There are few things to keep in mind when working with DOM and browser developer tools
1. Developer tools won't show unnecessary nodes such as #text nodes that contain only spaces and new lines and #comment nodes
2. When the html is not properly formed (leaving closing tag, not properly nesting, etc), creating DOM will auto correct it to its best knowledge
3. Tables will always have `tbody` node

## There are 12 types of nodes
Usually we work with these 4 types
1. document - Root
2. Element nodes - html tags
3. Text nodes = content
4. Comment nodes
