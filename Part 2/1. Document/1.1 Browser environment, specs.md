# Browser environment, specs
Even though we are calling `JavaScript` it is actually `ECMAScript` specification. That is why we hear things like `ES6` which stands for `ECMAScript 6`

The platform that implements ECMAScript specification is called `host environment`.
A web browser is implementing ecmascript and it is called javascript. A web server is implementing ecmascript and it is called nodejs and so on.

In web browser, we have a global object `window` which refers to the browser window. And has standard js features like Object, Date, Array and Functions. Additionally it has Browser specific object (called BOM, Browser Object Model) such as location, navigator, screen, frames, history and XMLHttpRequest. And it has DOM (Document Object Model) which has objects and methods to manipulate the document.

### Global object
```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

// global functions are methods of the global object:
window.sayHi();

console.log(window.innerHeight); // inner window height
```

## DOM
A specification to handle HTML in javascript called Document Object Model
```js
// change the background color to red
document.body.style.background = "red";

// change it back after 1 second
setTimeout(() => document.body.style.background = "", 1000);
```

### CSSOM
Another specification for CSS to be handled in javascript called CSS Object Model

## BOM
This object provides additional objects to work with browser environment other than Document such as `navigator` and `location`
It is called Browser Object Model

```js
console.log(location.href); // shows current URL
if (confirm("Go to Wikipedia?")) {
  location.href = "https://wikipedia.org"; // redirect the browser to another URL
}
```
