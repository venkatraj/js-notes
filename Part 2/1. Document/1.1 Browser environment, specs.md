# Browser environment, specs
Even though we are calling `JavaScript` it is actually `ECMAScript` specification. That is why we hear things like `ES6` which stands for `ECMAScript 6`

The platform that implments ECMAScript specification is called `host environment`.
A web browser is implementing ecmascript and it is called javascript. A web server is implementing ecmascript and it is called nodejs and so on.

In web browser, we have a global object `window` which refers to the browser window. And has standard js features like Object, Date, Array and Functions. Additionally it has Browser specific object (called BOM, Browser Object Model) such as location, navigator, screen, frames, history and XMLHttpRequest. And it has DOM (Document Object Model) which has objects and methods to manipulate the document.
