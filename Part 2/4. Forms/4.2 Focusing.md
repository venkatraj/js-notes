# Focusing: focus/blur
When an element receives focus, `focus` event happens and when looses focus, `blur` event happens

## Events focus/blur
```html
<style>
  .invalid { border-color: red; }
  #error { color: red }
</style>

Your email please: <input type="email" id="input">

<div id="error"></div>

<script>
input.onblur = function() {
  if (!input.value.includes('@')) { // not email
    input.classList.add('invalid');
    error.innerHTML = 'Please enter a correct email.'
  }
};

input.onfocus = function() {
  if (this.classList.contains('invalid')) {
    // remove the "error" indication, because the user wants to re-enter something
    this.classList.remove('invalid');
    error.innerHTML = "";
  }
};
</script>
```

## Methods focus/blur
We can programmatically set and unset focus on particular elements using `elem.focus()` and `elem.blur()` methods
```html
<style>
  .error {
    background: red;
  }
</style>

Your email please: <input type="email" id="input">
<input type="text" style="width:220px" placeholder="make email invalid and try to focus here">

<script>
  input.onblur = function() {
    if (!this.value.includes('@')) { // not email
      // show the error
      this.classList.add("error");
      // ...and put the focus back
      input.focus();
    } else {
      this.classList.remove("error");
    }
  };
</script>
```
Like `scroll` event, we can't prevent loosing focus by using `preventDefault()` on `blur` handler. Because it only runs after the element has lost its focus

### Javascript initiated focus loss
Our programs also cause focus loss on elements. For example, displaying an `alert` box causes it and also removing an element causes it.

Given that, if we want to track user initiated focus/blur, then we shouldn't cause it in our program

## Allow focusing on any element: tabindex
Not all elements can be focused by default. Only elements such as `button`, `input`, `a`, etc can have focus

Other elements such as `div`, `table` are not focusable. To make it focusable, we need to use `tabindex` attribute either in html or use `tabIndex` property of the element

`tabindex=0` gets focus only after all other elements with `tabindex>=1`
`tabindex="-1"` only gets focus when using `focus()` method. `tab` key will not result in focus

```html
Click the first item and press Tab. Keep track of the order. Please note that many subsequent Tabs can move the focus out of the iframe with the example.
<ul>
  <li tabindex="1">One</li>
  <li tabindex="0">Zero</li>
  <li tabindex="2">Two</li>
  <li tabindex="-1">Minus one</li>
</ul>

<style>
  li { cursor: pointer; }
  :focus { outline: 1px dashed green; }
</style>
```
Results in `1 => 2 => 0` and won't focus `-1`

## Delegation: focusin/focusout
`focus` and `blur` events do not bubble. So we can't use event delegation for those events. We need to use `focusin/focusout` events

```html
<!-- on focusing in the form -- add the class -->
<form onfocus="this.className='focused'">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="Name">
  <input type="text" name="surname" value="Surname">
</form>

<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>
```
In the above example only `input` receives focus which won't bubble. So it is not possible to call the `onfocus` handler

Even though `focus/blur` event don't bubble, the does capturing
```html
<form id="form">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="Name">
  <input type="text" name="surname" value="Surname">
</form>

<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>

<script>
  // put the handler on capturing phase (last argument true)
  form.addEventListener("focus", () => form.classList.add('focused'), true);
  form.addEventListener("blur", () => form.classList.remove('focused'), true);
</script>
```

`focusin/focusout` are same as `focus/blur` except that they do bubble. And its handlers should be added using `addEventListener` `onfocusin` won't work
```html
<form id="form">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="Name">
  <input type="text" name="surname" value="Surname">
</form>

<style> .focused { outline: 1px solid red; } </style>

<script>
  form.addEventListener("focusin", () => form.classList.add('focused'));
  form.addEventListener("focusout", () => form.classList.remove('focused'));
</script>
```
