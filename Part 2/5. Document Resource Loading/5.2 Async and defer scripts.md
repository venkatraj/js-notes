# Scripts: async, defer

If we use <script> in the head, the HTML parsing is blocked until it is downloaded and executed.

If we use <script> in the body (before closing tag), HTML parsing is not blocked. But if user decided to leave the page before it is fully loaded, we may loose some analytics data

## defer
This attribute tell the browser to download the script in the background without blocking HTML parsing. And will execute the script after DOM is ready, but before `DOMContentLoaded` event

It doesn't matter which script is downloaded first in the background, it runs in the same order it appears
```js
<script defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></script>
<script defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></script>
``` 
In the above example, `small.js` may be downloaded first. But `long.js` is executed first and then `small.js`

**NOTE** we can use `defer` only for external scripts

## async
This attributes instructs browser to download the script in the background without pausing HTML parsing, but executes it by pausing HTML parsing.

```js
<script async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js"></script>
<script async src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js"></script>
``` 
In the example code above, which one is downloaded first, will be executed first

## Dynamic scripts
We can also add script dynamically to our document

```js
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "/article/script-async-defer/long.js";
document.body.append(script); // (*)
```

It behaves like `async` by default. Which means it is downloaded in the background and start executing as soon as script is downloaded. It waits for nothing

We can change its default `async` behaviour by setting it to `false`

```js
function loadScript(src) {
  let script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = src;
  script.async = false;
  document.body.append(script);
}

// long.js runs first because of async=false
loadScript("/article/script-async-defer/long.js");
loadScript("/article/script-async-defer/small.js");
```
