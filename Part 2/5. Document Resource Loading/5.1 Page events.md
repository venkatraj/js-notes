# Page: DOMContentLoaded, load, beforeunload, unload

There are four important lifecycle events for an HTML page

* `DOMContentLoaded` - triggers when DOM tree is ready, but external resources (image, stylesheet) may not be loaded. 
* `load` - triggers when DOM tree is ready and all resources are loaded 
* `beforeunload` -> the user is trying leaving the page
* `unload` -> user left the page

## DOMContentLoaded
Happens on `document` object and must use `addEventListener`

```html
<script>
  function ready() {
    alert('DOM is ready');

    // image is not yet loaded (unless was cached), so the size is 0x0
    alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);
  }

  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ready);
</script>

<img id="img" src="https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&cache=0">
```

In the above example, we can access `img` because DOM is ready. But it may not return correct dimensions of image as `DOMContentLoaded` event won't ensure loading of external resources like images and stylesheets

### DOMContentLoaded and scripts
Even though this event won't wait for external resources to load, it does wait for other scripts to load

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    alert("DOM ready!");
  });
</script>

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.3.0/lodash.js"></script>

<script>
  alert("Library loaded, inline script executed");
</script>
```

**NOTE** If we don't want to wait for scripts to trigger DOMContentLoaded then we should use `async` attribute

### DOMContentLoaded and style
Similar to images, event doesn't wait to load stylesheets
But does WAIT for stylesheets coded like this
```html
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script>
  alert(getComputedStyle(document.body).marginTop);
</script>

  // the script doesn't not execute until the stylesheet is loaded
```

### Built-in browser autofill
Some browsers autofill forms if its users given their consent to do so. It is done when `DOMContentLoaded` triggers

## window.onload
When every thing is loaded html, style, images, scripts `load` event is triggered.

```html
<script>
  window.onload = function() { // same as window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
    alert('Page loaded');

    // image is loaded at this time
    alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);
  };
</script>

<img id="img" src="https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&cache=0">
```

## window.onunload
A visitor leaves the page, this `unload` event triggers. We can close related popup windows, send analytics data in the background, etc

```js
let analyticsData = { /* object with gathered data */ };

window.addEventListener("unload", function() {
  navigator.sendBeacon("/analytics", JSON.stringify(analyticsData));
};
```

## window.onbeforeunload
When user tries to close the window, we can ask for confirmation using this `beforeunload` event

```js

// Asks for confirmation when preventing default action of close
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
  return false;
};

```
## readyState
The state of document loading process can be checked in `document.readyState` property. There are 3 possible values

* `loading` – the document is loading.
* `interactive` – the document was fully read.
* `complete` – the document was fully read and all resources (like images) are loaded too.

```js
function work() { /*...*/ }

if (document.readyState == 'loading') {
  // loading yet, wait for the event
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', work);
} else {
  // DOM is ready!
  work();
}
```

There is a corresponding event called `readystatechange` which triggers whenever the state changes

```js
// current state
console.log(document.readyState);

// print state changes
document.addEventListener('readystatechange', () => console.log(document.readyState));
```
