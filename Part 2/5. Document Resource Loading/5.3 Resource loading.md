# Resource loading: onload and onerror
There are two events available for us to track resource loading. They are
* `onload` -> successful load
* `onerror` -> an error occurred during resource load

## Loading a script
Suppose a third party script doesn't support module, we can load it dynamically and wait for loading to be successful before using functions inside that script

For that purpose we use `script.onload`

```js
let script = document.createElement('script');

// can load any script, from any domain
script.src = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.3.0/lodash.js"
document.head.append(script);

script.onload = function() {
  // the script creates a helper function "_"
  alert(_); // the function is available
};
```

## script.onerror
Suppose there is an error while we try to load a third party script, then we can let the users know about that on `script.onerror` event

```js
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "https://example.com/404.js"; // no such script
document.head.append(script);

script.onerror = function() {
  alert("Error loading " + this.src); // Error loading https://example.com/404.js
};
```

## Other resources
The `load` and `error` events also work for other resources
```js
let img = document.createElement('img');
img.src = "https://js.cx/clipart/train.gif"; // (*)

img.onload = function() {
  alert(`Image loaded, size ${img.width}x${img.height}`);
};

img.onerror = function() {
  alert("Error occurred while loading image");
};
```

resource start loading as soon as it is added to document (append), but images are start loading as soon as there is a value for `src` 

<iframe> `load` events are triggered when loading is finished, whether it is successful or an error.

## Crossorigin policy

By default we can't access content of another site, even it is subdomain of same domain for security purpose.

In such case we can't access what is the error happened with external scripts. To allow this we need to use `crossorigin` attribute

1. If there is no `crossorigin` attributes then access is prohibited
2. `crossorigin="anonymous"` allows access, but remote server has to respond with header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `*` as value
3. `crossorigin="use-credentials"` allows access but server as to send back header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with our origin as value and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
