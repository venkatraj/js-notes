# Mutation observer

`MutationObserver` is a built-in object that observes a DOM element and fires a callback in case of changes.

## Syntax

```js
let observer = new MutationObserver(callback)

observer.observe(node, config)
```

`node` is the DOM element to be observed for changes

`config` is an object of boolean options

- `childList` –> observes the direct children of node,
- `subtree` – observes all descendants of node,
- `attributes` – attributes of node,
- `attributeFilter` – an array of attribute names, to observe only selected ones.
- `characterData` – whether to observe node.data (text content),
- `attributeOldValue` – if true, pass both the old and the new value of attribute to callback (see below), otherwise only the new one (needs attributes option),
- `characterDataOldValue` – if true, pass both the old and the new value of node.data to callback (see below), otherwise only the new one (needs characterData option).

The callback receives two arguments

- first is a list of `MutationRecord` objects
- second is the observer itself
