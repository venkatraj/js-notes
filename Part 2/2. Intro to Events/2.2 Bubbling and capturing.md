# Bubbling and capturing

## Event Propagation

The standard DOM Events describes 3 phases of event propagation:

1. Capturing phase – the event goes down from <html> to the element.
2. Target phase – the event reached the target element.
3. Bubbling phase – the event bubbles up from the element to <html>.

```html
<form>FORM
  <div>DIV
    <p>P</p>
  </div>
</form>

<script>
  for(let elem of document.querySelectorAll('*')) {
    elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(`Capturing: ${elem.tagName}`), true);
    elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(`Bubbling: ${elem.tagName}`));
  }
</script>
```
Using above code, if you click on `<p>`, you'll see
`HTML -> BODY -> FORM -> DIV` (capturing phase)
`P -> P` (target phase, triggers two times, as we've set handlers for both capturing and bubbling)
`DIV -> FORM -> BODY -> HTML` (bubbling phase)

## Bubbling

When an even happens the handler on it runs and then handler for same event of its parents also run one by one

```html
<form onclick="alert('form')">FORM
  <div onclick="alert('div')">DIV
    <p onclick="alert('p')">P</p>
  </div>
</form>
```
In the above code, if you click on `<p>`
then you'll see `P -> DIV -> FORM`

If you click on `<div>` 
then you'll see `DIV -> FORM`

If you click on `<form>` 
then you'll see `FORM` only as there is no other parent there

**NOTE** `Almost` all event bubble.
For example, `focus` event don't bubble, it is an exception

## event.target
`event.currentTarget` means the element that runs the handlers where as `event.target` means the element where the event happened.

```html
<form id="form">FORM
  <div>DIV
    <p>P</p>
  </div>
</form>

<script>
form.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  console.log('currentTarget: ', e.currentTarget) // form
  console.log('this:', this) // form
  console.log('target:', e.target) // element you clicked, either p or div or form
});

form.addEventListener('click', e => {
  console.log('currentTarget: ', e.currentTarget) // form
  console.log('this:', this) // window
  console.log('target:', e.target) // element you clicked, either p or div or form
});
</script>


```
In the above code `event.currentTarget` is always `<form>` because it the element that runs handler.

Where as `event.target` is where the event happened.

*NOTE* the different values of `this` when used normal and arrow function which doesn't have its own `this`

## Stopping bubbling
There is no need to stop bubbling. Normally it is not good to prevent a default process as other scripts may depend on it.

If there is a specific requirement, it can be done with custom event. 

Still there is a way to stop bubbling using `e.stopPropagation()`
```js
<body onclick="alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)">
  <button onclick="event.stopPropagation()">Click me</button>
</body>
```

If there are multiple handlers for a single event and you don't want other handlers to execute its code and don't want bubbling, then you should use `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`


## Capturing
Usually, we don't need this phase in real code.
In case, you want to use them, you can pass third argument to `addEventListener`

```js
elem.addEventListener(..., {capture: true})
// or, just "true" is an alias to {capture: true}
elem.addEventListener(..., true)
```

#### To remove the handler, removeEventListener needs the same phase

#### Listeners on same element and same phase run in their set order
```js
elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(1)); // guaranteed to trigger first
elem.addEventListener("click", e => alert(2));
```
