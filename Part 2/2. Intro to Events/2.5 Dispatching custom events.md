# Dispatching custom events

In addition to built-in events, we can create our own events in javascript. 

## Event constructor
Like all objects are based on `Object` class, all nodes are based on `Node` (which itself is based on Object), all events are based on `Event` class

We can create a `Event` object like so
`let event = new Event(type[, options]);`

* type => event type, a string like `click`, `my-event`
* options => the oject with two optional props
  * bubbles: true / false - If `true` event bubbles
  * cancelable: true / false - If `true` then default action may be prevented

By default, both are false `{ bubbles: false, cancelable: false }`

## Dispatch event
When a user clicks, the `click` event handlers are run automatically. To run our custom event handlers, first we make to make the `custom-event` happen.

Ofcourse, a user can't make this happen, but based on user interactions, our code can make it happen.

To do so, we call `elem.dispatchEvent(event)`

For example, to make `click` event happen programatically, we write this

```html
<button id="elem" onclick="alert('Click!');">Autoclick</button>

<script>
  let event = new Event("click");
  elem.dispatchEvent(event);
</script>
```

When the page loads, the click event happens automatically without any user interaction

**That leads to an interesting question, how can we differentiate between real event and script generated event?**

There is a `isTrusted` property on `event` object for that. Value can be `true/false`
```js
if (event.isTrusted) {
  console.log('A User Event')
} else {
  console.log('A Script Generated Event')
}
```

## Bubbling example
Custom events don't bubble by default. To make it bubble, we need to write code like this

```html
    <h1 id="elem">Hello from the script!</h1>
    <script>
      // create a bubbling custom event
      const customEvent = new Event('hello', {bubbles: true}); 

      // catch on document 
      document.addEventListener('hello', e => {
        console.log(`Hello from ${e.target.tagName}`) // Hello from H1
      });

      // dispatch it on element
      const elem = document.querySelector('#elem')
      elem.dispatchEvent(customEvent);
    </script>
```

**NOTE** steps are important. We need handlers attached first, before dispatching events.

## MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent and others
`Event` is base object, but there are different object for each user event type
* UIEvent
* FocusEvent
* MouseEvent
* WheelEvent
* KeyboardEvent
* and so on...

So, if we are going to create a custom mouse related event, then we should base `MouseEvent` for that rather than `Event`

**But Why?**
Because `MouseEvent` object has mouse related properties such as `clientX, clientY` whereas `Event` lacks them

```js
let event = new MouseEvent("click", {
  bubbles: true,
  cancelable: true,
  clientX: 100,
  clientY: 100
});

console.log(event.clientX); // 100

event = new Event("click", {
  bubbles: true, // only bubbles and cancelable
  cancelable: true, // work in the Event constructor
  clientX: 100,
  clientY: 100
});

console.log(event.clientX); // undefined, the unknown property is ignored!
```

We can work around such things by assign properties after creating object. But it is not recommended. Use appropriate constructors
```js
let event = new Event("click", {
  bubbles: true, // only bubbles and cancelable
  cancelable: true, // work in the Event constructor
});
event.clientX = 250

console.log(event.clientX); // 250
```

## Custom events
If we are creating events which are completely new and nothing like existing (MouseEvent, etc), then we should use `CustomEvent` constructor.

It is same as `Event` but can pass additional details about the event using `detail` property

```html
<h1 id="elem">Hello for John!</h1>

<script>
  // additional details come with the event to the handler
  const elem = document.querySelector('#elem')
  elem.addEventListener('hello', e => {
    console.log(e.detail.name);
    console.log(e.detail.age);
  });

  elem.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('hello', {
    detail: { 
      name: "John",
      age: 25,
    }
  }));
</script>
```

## event.preventDefault()
We can call `event.preventDefault()` even on custom events. But there is no browser default action to prevent.

However, `elem.dispatchEvent(evt)` return `true` if there is no `preventDefault` in handler, otherwise it returns `false`

So, using this we can decide what should happen, if a event handler prevent default

```html
<pre id="rabbit">
  |\   /|
    \|_|/
    /. .\
  =\_Y_/=
    {>o<}
</pre>
<button id="hide">Hide</button>

<script>
  const hide = document.querySelector('#hide')
  hide.addEventListener('click', e => {
    let event = new CustomEvent("hide", {
      cancelable: true // without that flag preventDefault doesn't work
    });
    let result = rabbit.dispatchEvent(event);
    console.log(result)
    if (!result) {
      console.log('The action was prevented by a handler');
    } else {
      rabbit.hidden = true;
    }
  })

  rabbit.addEventListener('hide', function(event) {
    if (confirm("Call preventDefault?")) {
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  });
</script>
```

## Events-in-events are synchronous
Normally, our main code runs, attaches event handlers and then finishes. When an event happens the handlers run. If another real event happens, then its handler will run only after completing current handler code which is asynchronous.

When an event handler dispatches an event in code, then it is run immediately (synchronously) and then current handler code continues

```html
<button id="btn1">1</button>
<button id="btn2">2</button>
<script>
  const btn1 = document.querySelector('#btn1')
  const btn2 = document.querySelector('#btn2')
  btn1.addEventListener('click', e => {
    console.log('First event starts')
    btn2.dispatchEvent(new Event('click'))
    console.log('First event code continues')
    btn2.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('hello'))
    console.log('First event complete')
  })

  btn2.addEventListener('click', e => {
    console.log('Second Event happened')
  })

  btn2.addEventListener('hello', e => {
    console.log('hello event handler runs')
  })

  // OUTPUT will be
  // First event starts
  // Second Event happened
  // First event code continues
  // hello event handler runs
  // First event complete
</script>
```
